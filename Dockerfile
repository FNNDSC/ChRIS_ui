# ChRIS_ui production mode server
#
# Build with
#
#   docker build -t <name> .
#
# For example if building a local version, you could do:
#
#   docker build -t local/chris_ui .
#
# In the case of a proxy (located at say 10.41.13.4:3128), do:
#
#    export PROXY="http://10.41.13.4:3128"
#    docker build --build-arg http_proxy=${PROXY} -t local/chris_ui .
#
# To run the server up, do:
#
#   docker run --name chris_ui -p 3000:3000 -d local/chris_ui
#
# To run an interactive shell inside this container, do:
#
#   docker exec -it chris_ui sh
#
# Tips:
# - for access logging, remove "--quiet" from CMD
# - docker-entrypoint.sh must start as root, and then
#   it creates an underprivileged user and downgrades itself.
#   This will not work on OpenShift where the container UID is random.
#   For high-security platforms, do not use docker-entrypoint.sh.
