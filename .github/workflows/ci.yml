# Automatically build multi-architectural tagged container images and push them to DockerHub
# https://github.com/FNNDSC/cookiecutter-chrisapp/wiki/Automatic-Builds
#
# - targeted platforms: x86_64, PowerPC64, ARM64
# - master is built as fnndsc/ChRIS_ui:latest
# - tagged commits are built as fnndsc/ChRIS_ui:<tag>
# - tagged commits are also uploaded to chrisstore.co
