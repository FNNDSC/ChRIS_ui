                  The Library provides a card-focused mechanism for browsing,
                  viewing, and interacting with data in the ChRIS system. A card
                  is analogous to a file or folder in a convention filesystem,
                  and multiple cards can be grouped into a shopping cart to
                  allow for bulk operations. Simply long press and release a
                  card to add it to the cart. Bulk operations include:{" "}
                  <b>Download</b> (which will copy all cart contents to your
                  local filesystem), <b>Delete</b> (which will permanently
                  remove all data in the cards from ChRIS), and <b>Create</b>{" "}
                  which will seed a new analysis with a new root node containing
                  each card as a subdirectory.
                </p>
              </Paragraph>
            }
            p2={
              <Paragraph style={pStyle}>
                In addition to browsing over the entire file space, the Library
                also allows for powerful searching across the three main parts
                of the ChRIS Library. The <Text strong>Uploads </Text>
                shows all the data (organized by folder) that has been uploaded
                from some external source (typically a filesystem). The{" "}
                <Text strong>Completed Analyses</Text> allows easy navigation
                down all the Analyses that have been completed in ChRIS. The{" "}
                <Text strong>SERVICES</Text> allows easy browsing of data
                associated with some external service, such as a Picture Archive
                and Communications System (PACS) database.
