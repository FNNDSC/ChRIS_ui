          This page consistes of three main sections, listing availalbe{' '}
          <b>Plugins</b>, <b>Pipelines</b>, and <b>Compute</b>.

        <Paragraph style={style}>
          Within ChRIS, <b>Plugins</b> are progams you can run and schedule -
          these are the core building blocks of ChRIS. Plugins are independent
          dockerized executables and ChRIS allows you to organize a set of
          plugins into a tree structure. In this tree, nodes correspond to
          plugins and data can be thought of as flowing along the branches from
          one plugin to its children. <b>Plugins</b> are usually
          installed/registered to ChRIS from a separate ChRIS store.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph style={style}>
          A <b>Pipeline</b> (or <b>Workflow</b>) is a named grouping of{' '}
          <b>Plugins</b> that exists as a single entity. <b>Pipelines</b> allow
          for easily running a set or group of <b>Plugins</b> together as if
          they were one entity (such as anonymizing data <i>and then</i> then
          analyzing the results <i>and then</i> generating a report). All the{' '}
          <b>Plugins</b> and <b>Pipelines</b> available in this ChRIS are
          catalogued here. Currently, you can add new <b>Pipelines</b> to this
          ChRIS by uploading a JSON pipeline description (see{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/FNNDSC/CHRIS_docs/tree/master/pipelines/source">
            here
          </a>{' '}
          for some examples). <b>Pipelines</b> are also available in the
          separate ChRIS store.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph style={style}>
          The final section on this page presents the available <b>Compute</b>{' '}
          environments that are known to ChRIS. These denote computers and
          clusters/clouds that can be selected to run various <b>plugins</b> and{' '}
          <b>pipelines</b>. The special <b>host</b> environment is always
          available and is the actual server that is running ChRIS. It is
          generally not recommended to run intensive computation on the{' '}
          <b>host</b> environment. Adding new <b>Compute</b> to ChRIS is
          typically enabled by using the separate ChRIS admin interface.
